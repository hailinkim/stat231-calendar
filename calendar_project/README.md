# Calendar Query Proposal 

Identify **2–4 primary questions** of interest to you about how you spend your time. We may be sharing results with peers, so **be sure you identify questions you feel comfortable sharing with your peers and instructor**. You will be collecting data daily for 14 days (or more!) after your proposal is approved. 


Feel free to expand upon the basic question of "How do I spend my time?" or explore a variation of it. Some other ideas include...
* Document *intended time* doing things (e.g. studying, sleeping) versus *actual time* doing those things, and compare results

* Document time spent on each course, and/or time spent on different parts of a course (e.g. in class, reading, homework, etc.)

* Document time spent on school vs. work vs. leisure vs. rest, etc.

* If you already use Google Calendar as a way to keep track of your schedule, you could compare how your time was spent last year at this time versus how your time is being spent this semester.

*Note that you are not wed to the ideas you record here.  The visualizations and table can change before your final submission.  But, I want to make sure your plan aligns with your questions and that you're on the right track. Note that you are not wed to the ideas you record here.

**Copy and paste these questions into a new issue in your private repo. Respond to these questions by 10pm ET on Thursday, September 9. I will respond with my approval or comments for revision.**

## Identify what questions you are planning to focus on

1. If I get the same amount of sleep, does the time I go to bed affect my productivity?
2. Do I spend more time when eating at Val or when eating the refrigerated foods in my room?
3. How much time do I spend on spiritual activities, i.e. praying or attending online services, and does the time I wake up affect how I spend my time?


## Describe two visualizations (type of plot, coordinates, visual cues, etc.) you imagine creating that help address your questions of interest

1. Stacked barplot

x-coordinate: whether I eat at Val or cook(more precisely, reheat refrigerated foods) in my room
y-coordinate: time spent (in minutes)
color: how I spent those times—for eating at Val, it will include walking over to Val and back to my room, eating, and talking with friends; for eating in my room, eating, cooking, and washing the dishes.
This plot will address the second question—whether I spend more time when eating at Val or eating in my room. Different colors of bars would indicate how I spend those times and might also suggest me what to reduce if I want to save some time.

2. Boxplot

x-coordinate: whether I slept early(before 11pm) or late(after 11pm)
y-coordinate: time I actually concentrated without getting distracted (in minutes)
The boxplot will demonstrate whether the time I go to bed affects my productivity, given I get the same amount of sleep.


## Describe one table (what will the rows be?  what will the columns be?) you imagine creating that helps address your questions of interest

Contingency Table

Rows: type of activities(spiritual, studying)
Columns: whether I woke up early(before 7am) or late(after 7am)
The contingency table will show the relationship between the time I wake up and how I spend my time. Through this plot, I would like to explore whether waking up early would allow me to spend more time on my spiritual activities or affect the time I spend on studying.
